# CheckersKotlinCompose
A very short checkers app demo to showcase my Kotlin and Jetpack Compose competencies.

Note: This is not a full checkers game. If you would like to see the full Checkers game version, check my profile for the Checkers app written in Java. 

I created this app to test using the Jetpack Compose framework and coding in Kotlin. Since the major difference is in how the UI is designed and deployed, I decided not to recreate the entire game once I implemented the basic functionality, as most of the game logic code under the hood would be the same. Next, I will be designing a Chess game in Kotlin using Compose, so stay tuned!
